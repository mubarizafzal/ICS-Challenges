/**
 * Problem: Create a program with 50 moving circles. 
 *          The program should also draw vectors in the opposite direction of which the circle is moving, with a length equal to the speed of the circle. 
 *          Store all of these vectors in an ArrayList. 
 *          Set a key to toggle whether to show the vectors or not (include arrow-heads to show the direction of the vectors).
 * 
 * Notes:
