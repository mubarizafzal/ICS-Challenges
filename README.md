# ICS-Challenges

These challenges were given out in grade 11 ICS, but I could only complete a few of them. It's been a few years, and I wanted to go back and finish this assignment.

The challenges can be found [here](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/archives/tree/master/ICS3U/ICS3U-2016-2017F/Challenges).

I begin with the third challenge in the second folder.
